<h1>My Projects</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Task List: In the Task List project, 
            I made a web API to organize my tasks. 
            I was able to create, read, update, and delete tasks using endpoints. 
            I also worked with Flask to create models, conventional RESTful CRUD routes for models, query 
            parameters, and created unconventional routes for custom behavior. I 
            also used postman as part of my development workflow. Lastly, I was able to 
            read, write, and use tests, and gain a greater understanding of the 
            client-server model.

        </li>
        <li>
            Swap Meet: The Swap meet project is an app where vendors can swap 
            items between different inventories. I created classes and added attributes 
            and instance methods to those classes. I imported modules and implemented
            inheritance.

        <li>
            Viewing Party: In the Viewing party project I solved 
            problems using conditional logic, lists, dictionaries, 
            nested loops, and nested datastructure.
