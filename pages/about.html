  <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    
      Hello, my name is cristal and I am in a student at ADA Developers Academy. 
      In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and jogging. 
      I am from Washington State and I love living here.
        <p>
        I began programming and learning python for fun during my senior year of high 
        school but I never considered that it could be a possible career for me. I thought this 
        because I did not think there was a space for me in the field and I had some doubts. I went 
        on to major in Applied Developmental Psychology and Spanish and graduated from Eastern Washington 
        University. During quarantine, which was during my final quarter of undergrad, I began to explore 
        different careers and I stumbled upon software development once more. This time, I did more research 
        and continued to learn. I read about Ada Developers Academy and it was then that I thought about the 
        possibility of me actually pursuing this as a career.
